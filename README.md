# MBTI Personality Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types based on text data. The code includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and the training of various machine learning models for personality prediction.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mbti-personality-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mbti-personality-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the `MBTI_Personality_Prediction.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions.

## Data

The MBTI dataset (`mbti_1.csv`) is used for personality prediction. The dataset includes posts and corresponding MBTI types.

## Data Preprocessing

The `pre_process_text` function is used for cleaning and processing text data. It removes URLs, non-words, duplicates, and stop words. It also binarizes the MBTI types.

## Model Training

Various machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, SGD, Logistic Regression, KNN, and SVM, are individually trained for each personality type.

## Prediction

To make predictions on new data, use the provided function and pass the cleaned text data.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using accuracy scores. Detailed evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score can be added for each personality type.

## Results

The project provides insights into predicting MBTI personality types based on text data.
